### 🏗️ About Me

I’m an architect and creative technologist with a unique blend of real-world architectural experience and advanced digital design skills. Over the past few years, I’ve led and completed architectural projects totaling over **80,000 square meters**, managing the full lifecycle from concept design to construction supervision.

In parallel, I’ve expanded into game development and virtual environments, creating interactive experiences for PC, mobile, and VR platforms. I’m currently working on an innovative **Digital Twin** project that combines architecture, simulation, and real-time data visualization using Unreal Engine.

My core tools include **Rhino, Grasshopper, Revit, V-Ray, and Unreal Engine**, enabling me to deliver high-quality designs and immersive experiences that blend the physical and digital worlds.

I’m open to remote architecture design projects as well as game and XR development roles.
